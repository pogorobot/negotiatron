The basic point of the Negotiatron is to work out a clear set of expectations that remain more-or-less in line with reality for the duration of a project.


## USE CASE 1: COLLABORATRON

Amy and Bruce are making a webcomic together. Amy thinks it should be about aliens. Bruce thinks it should be about Bigfoot. They both want to work together more than they want to "win". Negotiatron helps them get clear on what their actual sticking points are, and they end up creating a connective work of art that fulfills both of them creatively.

## USE CASE 2: CHORETRON

Platypus House has gotten real messy. There's never really been a system for assigning chores, and they've always been a disorganized source of resentment and annoyance. The house all work with Negotiatron to come up with a system that everyone can live with.

## USE CASE 3: UNSTICKTRON

It's just you, in your head, with yourself. You loser. You don't really know what you're doing with your life, or why you're doing it, or how to spend your energy most of the time. You fire up Negotiatron to try to get a handle on what your own goals actually are / should be.
